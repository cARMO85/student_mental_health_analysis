# Investigating Stress Factors for International Students in Japan
Welcome to this project on investigating stress factors for international students in Japan! 
**This project is intended as a mini-project to practice SQL queries and is not intended to be viewed as a full report.**

The goal of this project is to use a SQL database to explore what causes stress on international students' mental health in Japan. We will be using a dataset that contains information on international students' experiences in Japan, including their demographics, living arrangements, and perceptions of stress.

I hope you find this project interesting and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting!
